# Status

Stage: command-line prototype with optional live Jev integration.
Verified: 32 offline tests pass; dry run and live synthetic Jev workflow pass.

Latest: Rollouts validate the initial state and require an integer step bound from 1 to 1,000 before calling a policy.

Next: Collect independently checked teacher trajectories and test shifted environments.

Repository: https://github.com/Ppetip/skill-foundry
Budget: one shared $3 cumulative Jev allowance across the portfolio, never per project or cycle.
No other paid compute authorized. Eight initial calls across all projects used 3,303 input tokens;
estimated total $0.000138726, with $0.08 conservatively reserved. See README for limits.
Live smoke responses are not production benchmarks. No model training performed.

2026-09-21 CI pass: added pinned, read-only Windows/Linux Python 3.11/3.13 checks for unit tests and offline CLI contracts. Local checks and all four hosted Windows/Linux Python 3.11/3.13 jobs pass. No additional Jev calls.

2026-09-21 14:42 UTC budget fix: live clients require an existing ledger; explicit initialization refuses overwrite. Added four regression cases for missing/deleted/empty ledgers and preserved spending. All local tests, CLI checks, and four hosted Windows/Linux Python 3.11/3.13 jobs pass. No additional Jev calls.
